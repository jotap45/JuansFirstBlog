          <p>I learned about this course not long ago, through some friends that just graduated from it, and are also launching their startup rather soon</p>
          <p>When they told me how good it was, I decided to sign up and start learning scripting and programming languages so I up my skills and further my career as Business Analyst</p>
          <p>Just typing this paragraphs in sublime gives me great feeling that I will be able to create and write websites for me and my customers</p>
